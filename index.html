  <p>I am an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the <a href="http://www.philosophy.pitt.edu/" target="_blank">University of Pittsburgh</a>.  I work primarily in metaphysics, and I have interests in philosophy of science and epistemology. I am also on the planning committee for the   <a href="https://mawms.weebly.com" target="_blank">Midwest Annual Workshop in Metaphysics</a>.</p>

  <li> <em>"Physicalism as a Nomic Thesis"</em> <i>Email me for a draft.</i>(<a>Abstract</a>) 
  
  <div><p><br> One hallmark of a physicalist universe is that every mental, normative, or abstract fact depends in the right way on physical facts.  I argue that we cannot just look at how facts involving nonphysical phenomena depend upon physical facts to determine whether a world is physicalist.   Instead, we must determine which counterfactuals are supported at a world to determine whether that world is physicalist.  This is surprising because we can have a world in which nonphysical facts depend in the right way on physical facts but support nonphysicalist counterfactuals. If a world supports nonphysicalist, or “ghostly”, counterfactuals in my sense, then the world should be nonphysicalist.</p>

<p>I describe two cases that are inspired by ones found in the literature on Humeanism vs. Non-Humeanism about laws of nature. I suggest that there is an important parallel between the discussion of laws of nature and the characterizations of physicalism. Characterizations of physicalism, such as Grounding Physicalism, cannot accommodate the cases because they fail to capture certain features found in Non-Humean laws of nature. The solution is to modify our characterization of physicalism so that it is a nomic thesis—and one that is similar in form and character to a Non-Humean law of nature. This will involve both denying that statements of physicalism should take the form of universal generalizations and denying that physicalism holds wholly in virtue of the Humean mosaic and the patterns of dependence relations obtaining therein.</p>

   <li> <em>"The Power to Govern"</em><i> Email me for a draft.</i>(<a>Abstract</a>) 
  
   <div><p><br>I provide a new account of what it is for the laws of nature to govern the evolution of events. I locate the source of governance in the content of law propositions. As such, I do not appeal to notions of ground, essence, or production to characterize governance.  After introducing the account, I use it to outline previously unrecognized varieties of governance.  The laws must govern for them to have two theoretical virtues: explanatory power as well as a theoretical virtue I call expansiveness. A theory is expansive, roughly, when it can do more with less.

  <li> <em>"Humeans are out of this World"</em> </em> <i>Synthese</i> (2021)(<a>Abstract</a>) (<a href="Shumener Humeans out of this world.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>)
  
    <div><p><br>I defend the following argument in this paper. Premise 1: Laws of nature are intrinsic to the universe. Premise 2: Humeanism maintains that laws of nature are extrinsic to the
universe.  Conclusion: Humeanism is false. This argument is inspired by John Hawthorne’s (2004) argument in “Why Humeans are out of their Minds”.  My argument differs from his; Hawthorne focuses on Humean views of causation and how they interact with judgments about consciousness. He thinks Humeans are forced to treat
certain mental properties (insofar as they involve causal features) as extrinsic to conscious minds. I do not discuss causation or consciousness here. I focus on
Humean accounts of laws. I argue that Humean laws are extrinsic to the entire universe. As such, Humeans are not just out of their minds; they are out of this world. I aim to show that premises 1 and 2 are well-supported and that denying either of them
comes at a cost.  Nevertheless, some Humeans may prefer to reject 1 or 2 rather than
give up Humeanism. Even if the Humean takes one of these routes, the argument
above has philosophical import: it shows that Humeanism involves surprising
commitments.

 <li> <em> "Do Identity and Distinctness Facts Threaten the PSR?" </em> <i>Philosophical Studies</i> 2021(<a>Abstract</a>) (<a href="https://rdcu.be/b4GNU" target="_blank">Link to PDF</a>)

	<div><p><br>One conception of the Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR) maintains that every fact is metaphysically explained.  There are different ways to challenge this version of the PSR; one type of challenge involves pinpointing a specific set of facts that resist metaphysical explanation. Certain identity and distinctness facts seem to constitute such a set. For example, we can imagine a scenario in which we have two qualitatively identical spheres, Castor and Pollux.  Castor is distinct from Pollux but it is unclear what could metaphysically explain this distinctness fact. In this paper, I argue that such identity and distinctness facts do not challenge the PSR. We can metaphysically explain them.
	
	(Note: Even though the abstract to this paper is similar to the abstract to "Explaining Identity and Distinctness", the two papers offer different views. In this paper, I'm interested in explaining the identity and distinctness of entities belonging to various ontological categories. In the previous paper, I was only interested in identity and distinctness facts concerning concrete objects. Because of this shift in focus, I entertain different accounts for explaining identity and distinctness in the two papers.) </p></div>
  
      <li> <em> "Explaining Identity and Distinctness" </em> <i>Philosophical Studies</i> 2020 (<a>Abstract</a>) (<a href="Explaining Identity.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>)
	<div><p><br>This paper offers an explanation of object identity and distinctness.   It is tempting to try to distinguish objects on the basis of their possessing different qualitative features, where qualitative features are ones that do not involve identity. Yet, this criterion for object identity faces counterexamples: distinct objects can share all of their qualitative features.  In order to distinguish objects we need to look not only at which properties and relations objects instantiate but also <i>how</i> they instantiate these properties and relations. I suggest that objects are identical when they stand in certain qualitative relations in virtue of their existence.  An object that has a feature in virtue of its existence has that feature <i>existentially</i>.  The proposal is that objects are identical when they stand in specific relations existentially.  Objects are distinct if they do not stand in the same kinds of relations to one another in virtue of their existence; distinct objects stand in those relations <i>non-existentially</i>.</p></div>

    <div><p><br>Anti-Humeans come in many varieties, but Anti-Humeans about laws are united in their opinion that laws must be something “over and above” the Humean mosaic. My aim is to defend Anti-Humean accounts of laws against Humean accounts.  Here I argue that Anti-Humean accounts of laws are preferable to Humean accounts because Humean laws lack explanatory power.

  <div><p><br>This is a (weakly) opinionated survey paper.  Identity and distinctness facts are ones like, "The Eiffel Tower is identical to
the Eiffel Tower", and "The Eiffel Tower is distinct from the Louvre." This paper concerns one question in the metaphysics of identity: Are identity and distinctness facts metaphysically fundamental or are they nonfundamental? I explore some answers to this question. </i></p></div>

<ul id="abstract"> 
<li><i style="color:#00b386"> Identity </i> Cambridge University Press Elements Series (Under Contract) (<a>Abstract</a>) 
    <div><p><br>This book will discuss certain leading principles in the metaphysics of identity and the puzzling phenomena surrounding these principles.  I focus on what’s commonly referred to as “Leibniz’s Law”, the conjunction of the Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles and the Principle of the Indiscernibility of Identicals. Together, these two principles capture the plausible thought that, necessarily, any entities x and y are identical if and only if they share all the same features or properties.

This book ties together discussions of Leibniz’s Law from somewhat disconnected debates in metaphysics, philosophy of science, and philosophy of language. I examine the reasons for and against accepting Leibniz’s Law with a focus on contemporary treatment of the topic.  Next, I explore some options for rejecting the two principles. Philosophers offer modifications that aim to evade the counterexamples facing Leibniz’s Law, and we will see how they fare. 

The latter part of the book concerns the form identity criteria should take.  Leibniz’s Law provides necessary and sufficient conditions for when entities x and y are identical. These are sometimes called <i>material</i> or <i>modal</i> identity criteria.  We can also try to formulate <i>explanatory</i> identity criteria.  Explanatory identity criteria attempt to provide an explanatory basis for the identity and distinctness of entities. They tell us in virtue of what entities are identical or distinct. I explore the prospects for developing explanatory identity criteria and frameworks for formulating such criteria in terms of the notion of metaphysical ground.

  <!--<li> <em> &#8220;Intrinsicality and Metaphysical Analysis&#8221 </em> (<a>Abstract</a>) (email for a draft)
	<div><p><br>An object has a property intrinsically when that object has it "in virtue of how it is in itself." But how should we spell this out? There has been recent debate as to whether we should understand intrinsicality by appeal to modal resources or finer-grained "hyperintensional" resources instead. One hyperintensional resource that looks apt here is that of ground. This paper argues that we should develop a hyperintensional account of intrinsicality, but, surprisingly, grounding-based accounts of intrinsicality are unsuccessful. I defend a different hyperintensional approach that relies on the notion of a metaphysical analysis. Skow and Marshall also put forth analysis-based accounts of intrinsicality. I distinguish my account from their accounts. </p></div>
