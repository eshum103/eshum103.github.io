	   <div><p><br>If we were to learn that we live in a nonphysicalist universe, we would expect to be surrounded by some of the spooky usual suspects, such as ghosts, abstracta, fundamental qualia, or primitive normative facts. I suggest
that—given parallels between the physicalism debate and the debate about laws of nature—we can abandon this expectation. We can acknowledge
nonphysicalist universes containing none of the phenomena above. Inspired by the distinction between governing and non-governing accounts of laws of
nature, I show how recognizing a distinction between governing and nongoverning accounts of physicalism can help us make sense of such wild possibilities. </p></div>

	   <div><p><br>“Qua” or “as a” constructions appear in many philosophical contexts, including in metaphysics, philosophy of religion, philosophy of language, and philosophy of action. One important function of qua-ascriptions is to block violations of Leibniz’s Law. We can truthfully state that the old Penn Station was destroyed qua building and that the old Penn Station still exists qua pile of bricks without claiming that the old Penn Station was destroyed and still exists. That is, we can sometimes claim that an object x is F qua G without concluding that x is F. This paper uses the notion of real definition to provide an account of when we can and cannot infer x is F from the fact that x is F qua G. I apply the proposal to cases that potentially threaten Leibniz’s Law and explain how my proposal can be adopted by different metaphysical theories of qua-ascriptions.

	   <div><p><br>I provide a new account of what it is for the laws of nature to govern the evolution of events. I locate the source of governance in the content of law propositions. As such, I do not appeal to notions of ground, essence, or production to characterize governance.  After introducing the account, I use it to outline previously unrecognized varieties of governance.  The laws must govern for them to have two theoretical virtues: explanatory power as well as a theoretical virtue I call expansiveness. A theory is expansive, roughly, when it can do more with less.</p></div>

   <li> <em>Intrinsicality and Determinacy</em> <i>Philosophical Studies</i> 2022 (<a>Abstract</a>) 
  
	   <div><p><br>Comparativism maintains that physical quantities are ultimately relational in character. For example, an object’s having 1kg rest mass depends on the relations (such as: less massive than, as massive as, and so on) it stands in to other objects in the universe.  Comparativism, its advocates allege, reveals that quantities are not metaphysically mysterious: Quantities are reducible to familiar relations holding among physical objects. Modal accounts of intrinsicality—such as Lewis’s duplication account or Langton and Lewis’s combinatorial account—are popular accounts preserving many of our core intuitions regarding which properties are intrinsic. I argue that to endorse both comparativism and a modal account of intrinsicality, we must reject the plausible thesis that determinable properties are instantiated solely in virtue of their determinates. I call this 'the determinacy tension' and I suggest approaches for dissolving it. </p></div>

   <li> <em>Humeans are out of this World</em> <i>Synthese</i> 2021 (<a>Abstract</a>) (<a href="Shumener Humeans out of this world.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>)
  
	   <div><p><br>I defend the following argument in this paper. Premise 1: Laws of nature are intrinsic to the universe. Premise 2: Humeanism maintains that laws of nature are extrinsic to the universe.  Conclusion: Humeanism is false. This argument is inspired by John Hawthorne’s (2004) argument in “Why Humeans are out of their Minds”.  My argument differs from his; Hawthorne focuses on Humean views of causation and how they interact with judgments about consciousness. He thinks Humeans are forced to treat certain mental properties (insofar as they involve causal features) as extrinsic to conscious minds. I do not discuss causation or consciousness here. I focus on Humean accounts of laws. I argue that Humean laws are extrinsic to the entire universe. As such, Humeans are not just out of their minds; they are out of this world. I aim to show that premises 1 and 2 are well-supported and that denying either of them comes at a cost. Nevertheless, some Humeans may prefer to reject 1 or 2 rather than give up Humeanism. Even if the Humean takes one of these routes, the argument above has philosophical import: it shows that Humeanism involves surprising commitments. </p></div>

    <li> <em> Explaining Identity and Distinctness </em> <i>Philosophical Studies</i> 2020 (<a>Abstract</a>) (<a href="Explaining Identity.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>)

		<div><p><br>This paper offers an explanation of object identity and distinctness.   It is tempting to try to distinguish objects on the basis of their possessing different qualitative features, where qualitative features are ones that do not involve identity. Yet, this criterion for object identity faces counterexamples: distinct objects can share all of their qualitative features.  In order to distinguish objects we need to look not only at which properties and relations objects instantiate but also <i>how</i> they instantiate these properties and relations. I suggest that objects are identical when they stand in certain qualitative relations in virtue of their existence.  An object that has a feature in virtue of its existence has that feature <i>existentially</i>.  The proposal is that objects are identical when they stand in specific relations existentially.  Objects are distinct if they do not stand in the same kinds of relations to one another in virtue of their existence; distinct objects stand in those relations <i>non-existentially</i>.</p></div>

    <div><p><br>Identity criteria are powerful tools for the metaphysician. They tell us when items are identical or distinct. Some varieties of identity criteria also try to explain in virtue of what items are identical or distinct. This Element has two objectives: to discuss formulations of identity criteria and to take a closer look at one notorious criterion of object identity, Leibniz's Law. The first section concerns the form of identity criteria. The second section concerns the better-regarded half of Leibniz's Law, the indiscernibility of identicals. The third section turns to the more controversial half of Leibniz's Law, the identity of indiscernibles. I consider alternatives to Leibniz's Law as well as the possibility that there are no adequate identity criteria to be found.</p></div>

	  <li> <em> &#8220;Intrinsicality and Metaphysical Analysis&#8221 </em> (<a>Abstract</a>) (email for a draft)
	<div><p><br>An object has a property intrinsically when that object has it "in virtue of how it is in itself." But how should we spell this out? There has been recent debate as to whether we should understand intrinsicality by appeal to modal resources or finer-grained "hyperintensional" resources instead. One hyperintensional resource that looks apt here is that of ground. This paper argues that we should develop a hyperintensional account of intrinsicality, but, surprisingly, grounding-based accounts of intrinsicality are unsuccessful. I defend a different hyperintensional approach that relies on the notion of a metaphysical analysis. Skow and Marshall also put forth analysis-based accounts of intrinsicality. I distinguish my account from their accounts. </p></div>
