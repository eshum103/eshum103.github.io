  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I am an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the <a href="http://www.philosophy.pitt.edu/" target="_blank">University of Pittsburgh</a>. I work primarily in metaphysics, and I have interests in philosophy of science and epistemology. I am also on the planning committee for the   <a href="https://mawms.weebly.com" target="_blank">Midwest Annual Workshop in Metaphysics</a>.</p>

  <li> <em>"Identity and Ground"</em> </em> <i>Routledge Handbook for Metaphysical Grounding</i> (in prep)(<a>Abstract</a>) (PDF coming soon!) 
  
    <div><p><br>This is a chapter for the <i>Routledge Handbook for Metaphysical Grounding</i>.  I discuss the relation between identity criteria and ground. I also discuss whether and how to ground identity and distinctness facts. This is a draft. Comments welcome! </i></p></div>
   </li> 
  <li> <em> "Against Fundamental Identity and Distinctness" </em> <i>Philosophical Studies</i> (forthcoming)(<a>Abstract</a>) (email for a draft)

	<div><p><br>One conception of the Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR) maintains that every fact is metaphysically explained.  There are different ways to challenge this version of the PSR; one type of challenge involves pinpointing a specific set of facts that resist metaphysical explanation. Certain identity and distinctness facts seem to constitute such a set. For example, we can imagine a scenario in which we have two qualitatively identical spheres, Castor and Pollux.  Castor is distinct from Pollux but it is unclear what could metaphysically explain this distinctness fact. In this paper, I argue that such identity and distinctness facts do not challenge the PSR. We can metaphysically explain them.   </p></div>

    <div><p><br>I discuss Bennett's characterization of the <i>more fundamental than</i> relation. </i></p></div>

   <li><em>&#8220;Laws of Nature, Explanation, and Semantic Circularity&#8221</em> <i>The British Journal for Philosophy of Science</i> 2017 (<a>Abstract</a>) (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjps/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bjps/axx020/4682636?guestAccessKey=1fbbfa17-b2b9-4817-8a3b-ec0e0aaa7d9c"_blank">Link to PDF</a>)
    <div><p><br>Anti-Humeans come in many varieties, but Anti-Humeans about laws are united in their opinion that laws must be something “over and above” the Humean mosaic. My aim is to defend Anti-Humean accounts of laws against Humean accounts.  Here I argue that Anti-Humean accounts of laws are preferable to Humean accounts because Humean laws lack explanatory power.

  <li> <em> &#8220;The Metaphysics of Identity: Are Identity and Distinctness Facts Fundamental?&#8221 </em> <i>Philosophy Compass</i> 2017 (<a>Abstract</a>) (<a href="The Metaphysics of Identity 10.01.16.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>) 
 
  <div><p><br>This is a (weakly) opinionated survey paper.  Identity and distinctness facts are ones like, "The Eiffel Tower is identical to
the Eiffel Tower", and "The Eiffel Tower is distinct from the Louvre." This paper concerns one question in the metaphysics of identity: Are identity and distinctness facts metaphysically fundamental or are they nonfundamental? I explore some answers to this question. </i></p></div>

  <!--<li> <em> &#8220;Intrinsicality and Metaphysical Analysis&#8221 </em> (<a>Abstract</a>) (email for a draft)
	<div><p><br>An object has a property intrinsically when that object has it "in virtue of how it is in itself." But how should we spell this out? There has been recent debate as to whether we should understand intrinsicality by appeal to modal resources or finer-grained "hyperintensional" resources instead. One hyperintensional resource that looks apt here is that of ground. This paper argues that we should develop a hyperintensional account of intrinsicality, but, surprisingly, grounding-based accounts of intrinsicality are unsuccessful. I defend a different hyperintensional approach that relies on the notion of a metaphysical analysis. Skow and Marshall also put forth analysis-based accounts of intrinsicality. I distinguish my account from their accounts. </p></div>


<li> <em> a paper on intrinsicality and determinables </em> (<a>Abstract</a>) (email for a draft)
   <div><p><br> I argue that certain accounts of intrinsicality will treat determinable properties as <i>intrinsic</i> while treating their determinates as <i>extrinsic</i> and that this is not rad.  </p></div>

  <li> <em> a paper on laws of nature and governance </em> (<a>Abstract</a>) (email for a draft)
    <div><p><br>This paper offers an account of governance that doesn't involve any heavyweight notions of metaphysical dependence.</p></div>

  <li> <em> a paper on identity and quantitative relations </em> (<a>Abstract</a>) (email for a draft)
	<div><p><br>This paper offers an explanation of object identity and distinctness.   It is tempting to try to distinguish objects on the basis of their possessing different qualitative features, where qualitative features are ones that do not involve identity. Yet, this criterion for object identity faces counterexamples: distinct objects can share all of their qualitative features.  In order to distinguish objects we need to look not only at which properties and relations objects instantiate but also <i>how</i> they instantiate these properties and relations. I suggest that objects are identical when they stand in certain qualitative relations in virtue of their existence.  An object that has a feature in virtue of its existence has that feature <i>existentially</i>.  The proposal is that objects are identical when they stand in specific relations existentially.  Objects are distinct if they do not stand in the same kinds of relations to one another in virtue of their existence; distinct objects stand in those relations <i>non-existentially</i>.</p></div>

    <!-- <li> <em> a paper on physicalism and ground </em> (<a>Abstract</a>) (Currently Revising)
    
    <div><p><br>I argue that it is problematic to characterize physicalism in terms of ground, at least in the usual ways.  Characterizing physicalism in terms of ground faces two main problems: this approach treats intuitively non-physicalist theses as physicalist ones, and it sometimes treats intuitively physicalist theses as non-physicalist.  In this paper, I point out the cases that cause trouble for the grounding physicalist, and I try to explain why they cause trouble. I also explore an alternative to characterizing physicalist theses in terms of ground. This alternative involves the notion of a metaphysical analysis.</p></div>
